# dtx_codec
A golang based Apple DTX implementation. So you can run on real iOS devices: XCUITests, get CPU metrics, launch and kill apps from any OS without the need for expensive Apple hardware :-)

Will be added to go-ios eventually.
Use https://github.com/danielpaulus/ios_simulator_dtx_dump to get a dump of DTX messages to test the decoder with.
